# manage-repo

Currently, it's an opinionated wrapper around `git clone`, that keeps all your repos in structure. I wrote it to setup ready to go environment with all I need by one command

### Examples:

```sh
manage-repo clone myorg/myrepo
manage-repo clone "myorg/"
manage-repo clone ""
manage-repo "" --dry
```
